Power BI dashboard analyzing FMCG business performance based on sales, quantity and gross profit using simulated data

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes Sales, Quantity and Gross Profit performance for an FMCG company using Power BI Desktop.
The dashboard focuses on Year-to-Date (YTD) vs Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) comparison to identify performance gaps, regional issues, and product profitability.

Since Power BI Service publishing is unavailable on the free version, this project is shared via GitHub with PBIX file, screenshots, and documentation.

**Business Objectives**

Monitor performance YTD vs PYTD

Identify regions contributing to the decline

Analyze monthly trends and seasonality

Compare category performance

Segment products based on profitability (GP%) and pricing


**Dashboard Pages & Insights**

Summary Page

Focus: Overall performance & trends

Visuals included:

KPI cards (YTD, PYTD, % Change, GP%)

Monthly performance YTD vs PYTD trend

Category contribution by month

Bottom 5 regions with the largest YTD decline

_Key Insight:_

Gross Profit decreased 7% YoY in 2024

Late-year recovery observed, but overall YTD remains below PYTD

Several regions consistently underperformed, indicating structural issues rather than seasonal fluctuation

Detail Analysis Page

Focus: Root cause analysis

Visuals included:

Waterfall chart: YTD vs PYTD by Region

Bar chart: Gross Profit comparison by Category

Scatter plot: Product profitability segmentation (GP% vs Average Unit Price)

_Key Insight:_

West Java, Lampung, and Bali are the largest contributors to the decline

Personal Care remains the strongest category in absolute Gross Profit

Several products show high price but low GP%, indicating pricing or cost inefficiency

Used YTD & PYTD measures to enable fair year-over-year comparison

Applied dynamic metric selection (Sales / Quantity / Gross Profit)

Combined trend, contribution, and segmentation analysis in one report

Designed with executive-level readability and minimal visual noise
